The model for dangle tool is constructed in qgis version 3.1.16-Hannover and same is exported to script as 'Dangle v 3.0'. In case the model does not work properly, modify it with available alogrithm in the working QGIS verion. The script works in other version of QGIS but the output name is changed as 'Centroid' which represents the 'Over Shoot' and 'Under Shoot' points within the input tolerance.
